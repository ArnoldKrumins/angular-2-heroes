# Introduction to Angular with the Heroes app

## Setting up the app

Run the following commands:

`npm install -g live-server`

`npm install`

## Running the app

Run these two commands in two different terminals tabs:

`npm run tsc`

`npm start`

This should open a browser window with you app!
Now you can start changing your code and the browser window will be refreshed automatically.
